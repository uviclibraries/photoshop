# Bonus Activity: Removing the Background from Images
If you have a graphic or photo and need to get rid of the background and convert it to a transparent background, you may find this guide helpful. If you have any questions, please ask!

1. [Download this image for the exercise](https://pixabay.com/vectors/alarm-time-flat-wake-up-sleep-3122687/){:target="_blank"}
2. Open the photo in Photoshop by either clicking on the **Open button** or going to **File -> Open**. Find where you saved the photo and open it. If your browser automatically saved it for you, it is probably in your **Downloads** folder.

**3. Method #1: Magic Eraser Tool**

- 3.1 Unlock the layer for editing by opening up the **Layers** menu (in the right sidebar or **Window > Layers**). The image layer will be labeled **Background** with a small lock. **Click on the lock** to unlock the layer.
- 3.2 Find the **Magic Eraser Tool**: In the left toolbar menu, **click and hold on the Eraser Tool** icon and a menu containing three eraser tools will pop up. Select **Magic Eraser Tool**.
- 3.3 In the top properties menu, set the **Tolerance to 30**, make sure **Anti-alias** is checked and **Opacity** is set to **100%**.
- 3.4 Click on the background and all the touching areas in that colour will disappear, replaced with a grey and white checked background (indicating a transparent area). Click on all the areas of the background in different colour ranges until the only parts of the graphic left are what you want to keep.
- 3.5 Trim away excess space by clicking on **Image > Trim** in the top menu. Make sure **Transparent Pixels** is selected and click **OK**. All unnecessary parts of the image will be cropped out.
- 3.6 See the Exporting instructions at the end of this activity to save it.

**4. Method #2: Quick Selection Tool**
- 4.1 [Download this image for the exercise](https://unsplash.com/photos/xEX_o0haX6c){:target="_blank"}
- 4.2 Unlock the layer for editing by opening up the **Layers** menu (in the right sidebar or **Window > Layers**). The image layer will be labeled Background with a small lock. **Click on the lock** to unlock the layer. 
- 4.3 In the left toolbar menu, click on the **Quick Selection Tool**. 
- 4.4 In the top properties menu, make sure **New Selection** is chosen, **click on the little downward arrow** next to the brush size icon (round white icon) to increase the size of the brush to around **100**.

5. While **holding down the left mouse button**, use the selection brush to **draw over the subject** of your image (the person in the photo). Don’t get too close to the edge or the brush may select background areas.
6. **Release the mouse button** and click on the **Q key** on your keyboard. This will turn all the unselected area red. We will use this red area as a guide to clean up our selection.
7. Use the **Magnifying Glass** to zoom in closer to the subject so you can see the edges better.
8. Click on the **Brush Tool** in the left menu. Change the brush size to a comfortable size to work with (in this case, 50px should be a good size).
9. With the brush, use **White** to select more of the subject (erase the red) and use **Black** to deselect areas of the background that were selected (add red). To change the colour of the **Brush** tool, use the colour selector at the bottom of the left toolbar menu (the larger square sitting in front of another square is the brush colour. You can click on the tiny black and white icon above it to change the colour swatches to black and white. You can click on the tiny double arrow to switch back and forth between black and white.
10. Once you are satisfied with your selection, **click the Q key** on your keyboard again to show you the image with the selection around the subject.
11. Go to the top menu and click **Select > Inverse** to change the selection to the background area.
12. Click the **Delete** key on your keyboard to delete the background.
13. Trim away excess space by clicking on **Image > Trim** in the top menu. Make sure **Transparent Pixels** is selected and **click OK**. All unnecessary parts of the image will be cropped out. 

**Export as a PNG:**
14. Note: As the goal for these images is to be placed in another project, it’s best to export at full resolution. 

To export your image, click on **File -> Export > Export As** in the upper left corner. A window will pop up with options for resizing. Leave image size and quality at 100%,  but make sure the **Format** is set to **PNG** in the dropdown in the upper right corner of the Export window and the Transparency box is checked.. Click the **Export All** button in the bottom corner when ready. Another small window will pop up giving you an option to choose a save location. Choose a place on your computer to save the file and click **Save**.
